1. Obviously there a lot of case when statements.
    With a case when statement, SQL will have to look at the value of each record, to see if a string matches.
    This is likely to be slower than a select statement 
    with pipeline as (
        select where in ('pipeline')
    )
    union all banked_pledged as (
        select where in ('banked', 'pledged')
    )

2. Potential reorganization

The case when statements may be a symptom of tables that should be split up.  While reorganizing the 
tables may involve too much work with source tables, perhaps we could split them up into separate tables in an analytics database.

For example, when in 
(pipeline is associated with CFY columns AllocatedBestCaseCFYUSDAmt

3. Join statements
Are all of these necessary?

4. Readability
    Working through a file 500 lines long can be difficult to navigate.
    A tool like DBT would encourage making this more modular with separate scripts for cleaning up each file.
    

5. Should there be separate mart tables instead of one large view?
  By doing so, potentially we could avoid some of the joins.

6. Materialized views to speed up?
